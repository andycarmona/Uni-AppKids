A project with different learning tools for kids.
Frontend is build with Angularjs and bootstrap and communicates with Backend (Web Api) via RESt request which uses Json as protocol.
There is an integration with a DotNetNuke CMS portal wich uses  module with Web api functionality to get/send data to frontend part. By using a CMS did I get  lot of functionality out of the box: Authentication, Editing content on the fly, User management, etc

Technics: 

FrontEnd Dotnetnuke web api module, Angularjs, bootstrap.
